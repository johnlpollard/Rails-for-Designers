# Rails for Designers Class

Building an interface requires a flow of inputs and outputs - not just a series of static screens pasted together. As Ryan Singer from Basecamp stated, "You can’t truly evaluate an interface until you can use it, and you can’t use it until you build it."

In this course, designers will learn how to build out their static screens into semi-functional Rails prototypes. We will cover the basic architecture of Ruby on Rails and how to write simple Ruby, HTML, and JavasScript in the Rails framework.

By the end of the course, you will be a more independent designer. You'll be able to turn your design into a functional prototype and have a better understanding of the considerations programmers make when coding applications.
